#### Intro
Hi, I'm Abdul and I am a freelance developer. I mainly do web and mobile development but I also develop games as a hobby. I love learning new things and growing as a person. I am currently learning data science and Japanese. I consider myself an environmentalist.

I am available to consult on interesting projects and for remote work.  My skills are balanced between front end to back end development. I enjoy each aspect, and love building sites & mobile apps from start to finish for clients.

#### Some History

- I was born in Nigeria and spent most of my early life in the country. I had always been obsessed with computer games. Growing up, I remember we had an old desktop that ran Ms Dos and my uncle who was a software engineer at the time had installed a couple games for me. My favorite games were Dangerous Dave, Doom, and Sid Meier's Civilization(although I was like 5 at the time and had no idea what was going on most of the time). 

- At 7, I discovered the mini-games hidden in Microsoft Office. I also beat Minesweeper on expert for the first time.

- In the summer of 2005, my parents purchased my first console which was a playstation portable. Unfortunately in Nigeria, we didn't have access to a lot of newer games so my choices were limited. I got bored of playing the same 2 games everyday and so I researched online and i found out I could ["crack"](https://www.thegeeksclub.com/crack-psp-1000-2000-3000-model/) my psp and install ISO files of games(looking bad at this I'm not too proud. Piracy is bad, kids!!). I hooked it up to my computer, followed the instructions and I was able to crack the psp and fit as many games as i could into its memory stick. They were all in Japanese and I couldnt understand a thing but I was ecstatic that I had new games to play and I solved my problems with computer and my own two hands.

- At 12, I  moved into boarding school where I would spend most of my adolescent life. Before I went to boarding school my parent got me a laptop can't remember which one it was but it was one of those shine hp laptops. As usual when I wasn't practising maths or reading up on physics I was playing games on my laptop. I also started making mods for GTA San Andreas and minecraft which i distributed to my friends. I really had a great time making those.

- Couple years later I was just about done with secondary school and I wasn't sure exactly where i was going career wise, I just knew I wanted to do something with games. I ended up moving to Canada where I re-did my final year of high school because not all my credits transferred. However I am extremely grateful for this because it was during time here that my art skills were subpar but I took an AP computer science class and I fell in love with coding. 

- At university , I was able to explore various parts of computer science with my electives. I also really appreciated the mindset game development gave me, it really influenced the way I coded and the approach I took to solving problems.

- In my second year of university, I started going for game jams and hackathons. I loved this because it took my head out of an academic space and I worked on projects that were fun because I wanted to and not because I had to meet a deadline for a grade.

- I graduated from university in 2019, and I work at a software company in Ottawa, Ontario
